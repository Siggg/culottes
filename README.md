# culottes

Culottes lets your community vote and bet on whoever deserves or needs additional income according to your cause requirements. It collects donations and vote taxes then redistributes that income among winners.

Anybody can claim they match the cause requirements and apply for income. Anybody can vote for or against any candidate.

Specific culottes could redistribute income for specific causes:

* big contributors to **opensource software projects**
* great **artists** with not so great income
* winners of oceans cleaning bounties who keep **cleaning beaches** once bounties are over
* big contributors to the **Wikipedia**
* **social entrepreneurs** with a proven track of record
* people currently living in **Mali**
* people struggling with **less than 1 dollar of income per day*
* volunteers who give almost 100% of their culottes income directly to **homeless people**
* _What's your social justice cause ? It probably deserves its own culottes game and source of income!_
* ...

Thanks to the culottes system, truth prevails more often than not and your culottes can enable social justice. Game theorists call this voting and betting system a "Schelling game". It can serve any decentralized cause. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0.
