# Demo use case

## Intro

Jean: " Hey Mohamed, you are a big contributor to open source projects, aren't you ? "

Mohamed: " Sure, I spend hours on free software stuff. Why ? "

Jean: " Look, there is this culottes source of Eth for big contributors to open source projects. I think you really deserve and need some additional income from this source. Flash it and I will vote for you. "

## Mohamed votes Yes for himself

Mohamed: " Well, ok. Let me flash it. "

Mohamed flashes this QRCode with his mobile phone wallet, from his Ethereum address.

He sends a cent of Eth to the culotte for 'big contributors to open source projects'.

The Culotte twitter account announces it received a 0.01 ETH ballot for Mohamed (Mohamed has an ENS name). The tweet links to Mohamed's election page.

## Jean votes for Mohamed too

Jean clicks on Mohamed's election link. Mohamed's ENS name is displayed on the screen, with a big question below :

" Is this the address of a big contributor to open source projects ? "

Mohamed's election gave him no ETH yet.

Below " Yes ", we already see 0.01 ETH, and 1 ballot from Mohamed himself.

Below " No ", there is 0 ETH and 0 ballots.

There is no verdict issued yet. So the question is still open.

Jean clicks on Yes and send some more Eth supporting Mohamed's election.

## Axel votes against Mohamed

Axel comes in : " Hey guys, are you serious ??? Mohamed sure contributes to open source projects. But I don't think he qualifies as a 'big' contributor. I'll vote No. "

Axel connects with Metamask and votes no.

## Mohamed earns his first income from the culotte

Or not.

## Candidates compare their contributions

[This issue report](https://github.com/Siggg/culottes/issues/1) shows how github contributors could publish their Ethereum address so that anyone can vote for or against their address once they have visited the associated github profile and its contribution activity.

## Explore open citizen trials

The culottes page displays the list of citizen trials and their status : verdict issued or not ? accepted or rejected ? how much Eth distributed to each so far ? how many votes for and against each citizen.
