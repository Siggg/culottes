   <i class="icon balance scale"></i>
   Your vote may randomly close their trial (50% chance of verdict per distribution period). When their trial closes, the YES stakes and the NO stakes are summed and compared. The verdict is issued accordingly. The loosing voters loose their stakes. A share of the lost stakes is donated for further distributions. And the rest of the lost stakes are shared among winning voters proportionately to their winning stakes, which they also get back (minus transaction safety fees). Read <a href="https://siggg.gitlab.io/culottes/rules/#step-5-verdict-and-rewards">step 5 of the rules of the Culottes board game</a> for a better understanding of the behavior of this revolution when issuing verdicts and distributing vote stakes.
