# culottes

Culottes lets your community vote and bet on whoever deserves or needs additional income according to your cause requirements. It collects donations and vote taxes then redistributes that income among winners.

Anybody can claim they match the cause requirements and apply for income. Anybody can vote for or against any candidate.

Specific culottes could redistribute income for specific causes:

* [big contributors to **opensource software projects**](/src/index.html)
* [great **artists** with not so great income](how_to.md)
* [winners of oceans cleaning bounties who keep **cleaning beaches** once bounties are over](how_to.md)
* [big contributors to the **Wikipedia**](how_to.md)
* [**social entrepreneurs** with a proven track of record](how_to.md)
* [people currently living in **Mali**](how_to.md)
* [people struggling with **less than 1 dollar of income per day*](how_to.md)
* [volunteers who give almost 100% of their culottes income directly to **homeless people**](how_to.md)
* [_What's your social justice cause ? It probably deserves its own culottes game and source of income!_](how_to.md)
* ...

Thanks to the culottes system, truth prevails more often than not and your culottes can enable social justice. Game theorists call this voting and betting system a "Schelling game". It can serve any decentralized cause and you can [create your own culottes for your community cause](how_to.md). It runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

# What does "culottes" mean ?

Culottes were fashionable silk knee-breeches (fancy trousers) typical of the French aristocracy in 1789 during the French Revolution. The "Sans-Culottes" were litterally "Without-Breeches". They were starving and had enough with privileges and social injustice. So they stormed the Bastille, abolished privileges and beheaded their king. If only they had had a culottes dapp...
