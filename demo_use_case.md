# Demo use case

## Intro

Jean: " Hey Mohamed, you are a big contributor to open source projects, aren't you ? "

Mohamed: " Sure, I spend hours on free software stuff. Why ? "

Jean: " Look, there is this culottes source of Eth for big contributors to open source projects. I think you really deserve and need some additional income from this source. Flash it and I will vote for you. "

## Mohamed votes Yes for himself

Mohamed: " Well, ok. Let me flash it. "

Mohamed flashes this QRCode with his mobile phone wallet, from his Ethereum address.

He sends a cent of Eth to the culotte for 'big contributors to open source projects'.

The Culotte twitter account announces it received a 0.01 ETH ballot for Mohamed (Mohamed has an ENS name). The tweet links to Mohamed's election page.

## Jean votes for Mohamed too

Jean clicks on Mohamed's election link. Mohamed's ENS name is displayed on the screen, with a big question below :

" Is this the address of a big contributor to open source projects ? "

Mohamed's election gave him no ETH yet.

Below " Yes ", we already see 0.01 ETH, and 1 ballot from Mohamed himself.

Below " No ", there is 0 ETH and 0 ballots.

There is no verdict issued yet. So the question is still open.

Jean clicks on Yes and send some more Eth supporting Mohamed's election.

## Axel votes against Mohamed

Axel comes in : " Hey guys, are you serious ??? Mohamed sure contributes to open source projects. But I don't think he qualifies as a 'big' contributor. I'll vote No. "

Axel connects with Metamask and votes no.

## Mohamed earns his first income from the culotte

Or not.

## Explore open votes

The culottes page displays the list of applicants and their status : verdict issued or not ? accepted or rejected ? how much Eth distributed to each so far ?
