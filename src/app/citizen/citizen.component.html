   Your vote may randomly close their trial. When their trial closes, the YES stakes and the NO stakes are summed and compared. The verdict is issued accordingly. The loosing voters loose their stakes. The bastille takes a share of the lost stakes as a tax. And the rest of the lost stakes are shared among winning voters proportionately to their winning stakes, which they also get back (minus transaction safety fees). Read <a href="https://siggg.gitlab.io/culottes/rules/#step-5-verdict-and-rewards">step 5 of the rules of the Culottes board game</a> for a better understanding of the behavior of this bastille when issuing its verdict and distributing vote stakes.
